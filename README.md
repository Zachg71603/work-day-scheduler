# work-day-scheduler

This website is a scheduling application that allows you to input your daily schedule and save what you enter. The time slots update their color based on the time of the day, with green being the future times, red being the current, and grey being the past. This project was refreshing for me because I enjoy working on HTML as of now. I can see myself making things like schedules in a job one day, so this is a project I am glad I did.
